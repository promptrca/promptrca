# Deployment Checklist - New RCA Tools

## Pre-Deployment

### 1. Review Changes
- [ ] Read `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Review `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md`
- [ ] Check `docs/NEW_TOOLS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

### 2. Verify IAM Permissions
- [ ] Add AWS Health permissions to Lambda execution role:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "health:DescribeEvents",
      "health:DescribeEventDetails",
      "health:DescribeAffectedEntities"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add CloudTrail permissions:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "cloudtrail:LookupEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add Service Quotas permissions:
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota",
      "servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
  ```

### 3. Verify AWS Prerequisites
- [ ] Confirm AWS Support plan (Business/Enterprise for Health API)
- [ ] Verify CloudTrail is enabled in your account
- [ ] Check CloudTrail retention period (recommend 90+ days)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment
- [ ] Deploy new files:
  - `src/promptrca/tools/aws_health_tools.py`
  - `src/promptrca/tools/cloudtrail_tools.py`
- [ ] Deploy modified files:
  - `src/promptrca/tools/__init__.py`
  - `src/promptrca/core/direct_orchestrator.py`
  - `src/promptrca/agents/lead_orchestrator.py`
  - `src/promptrca/agents/specialized/lambda_agent.py`
  - `src/promptrca/agents/specialized/iam_agent.py`

### 2. Test in Development
- [ ] Test AWS Health tool:
  ```bash
  python -c "
  from promptrca.tools import check_aws_service_health
  import json
  result = check_aws_service_health('LAMBDA', 'us-east-1')
  print(json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=2))
  "
  ```
- [ ] Test CloudTrail tool:
  ```bash
  python -c "
  from promptrca.tools import get_recent_cloudtrail_events
  import json
  result = get_recent_cloudtrail_events('test-function', 24)
  print(json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=2))
  "
  ```
- [ ] Run full investigation test:
  ```bash
  python -m promptrca.cli investigate --function-name test-function
  ```

### 3. Verify Integration
- [ ] Check DirectInvocationOrchestrator logs for AWS Health checks
- [ ] Check LeadOrchestratorAgent logs for CloudTrail usage
- [ ] Verify no errors in specialist agents

---

## Post-Deployment

### 1. Monitor First Investigations
- [ ] Check logs for AWS Health API calls
- [ ] Check logs for CloudTrail API calls
- [ ] Verify tools are being called in correct order
- [ ] Monitor for any permission errors

### 2. Validate Improvements
- [ ] Track investigation speed (should be 30-50% faster for deployment issues)
- [ ] Monitor false positive rate (should decrease)
- [ ] Check if AWS service issues are detected correctly
- [ ] Verify CloudTrail changes are correlated with incidents

### 3. Team Training
- [ ] Share `docs/NEW_TOOLS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with team
- [ ] Demonstrate new investigation flow
- [ ] Show example of AWS Health detection
- [ ] Show example of CloudTrail change correlation

## Troubleshooting

### AWS Health API Errors

**Error**: "AWS Health API requires Business or Enterprise support plan"
- **Expected**: This is normal if you don't have Business/Enterprise support
- **Action**: Tools will gracefully fail, investigation continues without AWS Health
- **Optional**: Upgrade to Business support for AWS Health access

### CloudTrail Errors

**Error**: "CloudTrail may not be enabled"
- **Action**: Enable CloudTrail in AWS Console
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to CloudTrail console
  2. Create a trail
  3. Enable for all regions
  4. Wait 15 minutes for events to appear

**Error**: "No events found"
- **Possible causes**:
  - Resource name doesn't match CloudTrail resource name
  - No changes in the time window
  - CloudTrail retention period expired
- **Action**: Verify resource name, increase time window

### Permission Errors

**Error**: "AccessDenied" on health:DescribeEvents
- **Action**: Add IAM permissions (see Pre-Deployment section)

**Error**: "AccessDenied" on cloudtrail:LookupEvents
- **Action**: Add IAM permissions (see Pre-Deployment section)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback is simple:

### Option 1: Disable New Tools (Quick)
```python
# In direct_orchestrator.py, comment out AWS Health + CloudTrail checks
# Lines 85-130 in _collect_evidence()

# STEP 1: Check AWS Service Health FIRST
# logger.info("üè• Step 1: Checking AWS Service Health...")
# ... (comment out entire section)

# STEP 2: Check for recent configuration changes
# logger.info("üìã Step 2: Checking CloudTrail...")
# ... (comment out entire section)
```

### Option 2: Revert Files (Full)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or restore specific files
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/promptrca/tools/aws_health_tools.py
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/promptrca/tools/cloudtrail_tools.py
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/promptrca/core/direct_orchestrator.py
```

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 (Monitoring)
- [ ] No critical errors from new tools
- [ ] AWS Health checks working (or gracefully failing)
- [ ] CloudTrail checks working
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Week 2 (Validation)
- [ ] At least 1 AWS service issue detected correctly
- [ ] At least 3 deployment-related issues identified via CloudTrail
- [ ] Investigation speed improved for deployment issues
- [ ] Team feedback is positive

### Month 1 (Success)
- [ ] 30%+ faster investigations for deployment issues
- [ ] Reduced false positives (not blaming code when AWS is down)
- [ ] Team regularly uses new tools
- [ ] No rollbacks needed

## Support

### If You Need Help:
1. Check logs for detailed error messages
2. Review `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md` for troubleshooting
3. Check IAM permissions are correctly configured
4. Email: christiangenn99+promptrca@gmail.com

### Common Questions:

**Q: Do I need Business support for this to work?**
A: No. AWS Health is optional. CloudTrail works on all plans.

**Q: Will this slow down investigations?**
A: No. AWS Health + CloudTrail checks add <1 second. Overall investigations are 30-50% faster.

**Q: What if CloudTrail isn't enabled?**
A: Tools will gracefully fail. Enable CloudTrail for future investigations.

**Q: Can I use this in production immediately?**
A: Yes. Changes are backward compatible and production-ready.
