# PromptRCA Improvements - January 2025

## Overview

This document describes the critical improvements made to PromptRCA based on AWS RCA best practices and industry standards.

---

## üéØ Critical Improvements Implemented

### 1. AWS Service Health Integration

**Problem**: Previously, PromptRCA would investigate application code even when AWS itself was experiencing issues.

**Solution**: Added AWS Health API integration to check service status FIRST.

**New Tools**:
- `check_aws_service_health(service_name, region)` - Check if AWS service has active incidents
- `get_account_health_events(hours_back)` - Get all AWS Health events for the account
- `check_service_quota_status(service_code)` - Check if service quotas are being hit

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Saves investigation time when AWS is having issues
- ‚úÖ Prevents false positives (blaming your code when AWS is down)
- ‚úÖ Industry standard: All major observability platforms check service health first

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Check if Lambda service is healthy
health_check = check_aws_service_health('LAMBDA', 'us-east-1')

# Result if AWS has issues:
{
  "aws_service_issue_detected": true,
  "service": "LAMBDA",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "active_events_count": 2,
  "active_events": [
    {
      "event_type": "AWS_LAMBDA_OPERATIONAL_ISSUE",
      "status": "open",
      "start_time": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Integration**:
- DirectInvocationOrchestrator: Checks AWS Health in Step 1 of evidence collection
- LeadOrchestratorAgent: Prioritizes AWS Health tools in tool list
- All specialist agents: Can call AWS Health tools when needed

---

### 2. CloudTrail Configuration Change Tracking

**Problem**: 80% of AWS incidents are caused by recent configuration changes, but PromptRCA wasn't checking CloudTrail.

**Solution**: Added CloudTrail integration to track "what changed?" before incidents.

**New Tools**:
- `get_recent_cloudtrail_events(resource_name, hours_back)` - Get config changes for a resource
- `find_correlated_changes(incident_time, window_minutes)` - Find all changes around incident time
- `get_iam_policy_changes(role_name, hours_back)` - Track IAM policy modifications

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Identifies deployment-related issues immediately
- ‚úÖ Correlates configuration changes with incident timing
- ‚úÖ Tracks who made changes and when
- ‚úÖ Essential for "what changed?" RCA analysis

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Check for recent Lambda function changes
changes = get_recent_cloudtrail_events('my-lambda-function', 24)

# Result:
{
  "resource_name": "my-lambda-function",
  "total_events": 3,
  "configuration_changes_detected": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "event_time": "2025-01-20T09:45:00Z",
      "event_name": "UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
      "username": "john.doe@company.com",
      "request_parameters": {
        "timeout": 30,  # Changed from 60 to 30
        "memorySize": 512
      }
    },
    {
      "event_time": "2025-01-20T09:30:00Z",
      "event_name": "UpdateFunctionCode",
      "username": "ci-cd-pipeline"
    }
  ]
}

# Find correlated changes across services
correlated = find_correlated_changes("2025-01-20T10:00:00Z", 30, "lambda,iam")

# Result shows all changes in 30min window before incident:
{
  "incident_time": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
  "window_minutes": 30,
  "total_changes": 5,
  "correlation_detected": true,
  "changes_by_service": {
    "lambda": [
      {
        "event_name": "UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
        "minutes_before_incident": 15
      }
    ],
    "iam": [
      {
        "event_name": "DetachRolePolicy",
        "minutes_before_incident": 10
      }
    ]
  },
  "analysis": {
    "high_risk_changes": [...],  # Changes within 10min of incident
    "deployment_detected": true
  }
}
```

**Integration**:
- DirectInvocationOrchestrator: Checks CloudTrail in Step 2 of evidence collection
- LeadOrchestratorAgent: Prioritizes CloudTrail tools in investigation flow
- Lambda Agent: Uses `get_recent_cloudtrail_events()` to check for deployments
- IAM Agent: Uses `get_iam_policy_changes()` to track permission changes

## üìã Updated Investigation Flow

### Before (Old Flow):
```
1. Parse inputs
2. Discover resources from X-Ray
3. Call specialist agents
4. Synthesize findings
```

### After (New Flow):
```
1. **Check AWS Service Health** ‚Üê NEW (rule out AWS issues)
2. **Check CloudTrail for changes** ‚Üê NEW (find "what changed?")
3. Parse inputs
4. Discover resources from X-Ray
5. Call specialist agents
6. Synthesize findings
```

**Why This Order Matters**:
- **AWS Service Health**: If AWS is down, stop investigation immediately
- **CloudTrail**: 80% of incidents = recent config changes, check this early
- **X-Ray**: Shows actual error flow and affected services
- **Specialists**: Deep dive into specific service issues

## üîß Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/promptrca/tools/aws_health_tools.py` - AWS Health API integration
2. `src/promptrca/tools/cloudtrail_tools.py` - CloudTrail change tracking
3. `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md` - This documentation

### Files Modified:
1. `src/promptrca/tools/__init__.py` - Added new tool exports
2. `src/promptrca/core/direct_orchestrator.py` - Integrated AWS Health + CloudTrail checks
3. `src/promptrca/agents/lead_orchestrator.py` - Updated system prompt and tool list
4. `src/promptrca/agents/specialized/lambda_agent.py` - Added CloudTrail usage
5. `src/promptrca/agents/specialized/iam_agent.py` - Added IAM policy change tracking

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### For DirectInvocationOrchestrator (Automatic):
The new checks are automatically integrated. No code changes needed.

```python
# Just run investigation as normal
orchestrator = DirectInvocationOrchestrator(region='us-east-1')
report = await orchestrator.investigate(inputs)

# The orchestrator will automatically:
# 1. Check AWS Service Health
# 2. Check CloudTrail for changes
# 3. Continue with normal investigation
```

### For LeadOrchestratorAgent (Automatic):
The agent now has access to the new tools and will use them based on the updated system prompt.

```python
# The agent will automatically prioritize:
# 1. check_aws_service_health()
# 2. get_recent_cloudtrail_events()
# 3. Then proceed with specialist delegation
```

### Manual Tool Usage:
You can also call these tools directly:

```python
from promptrca.tools import (
    check_aws_service_health,
    get_recent_cloudtrail_events,
    find_correlated_changes
)

# Check Lambda service health
health = check_aws_service_health('LAMBDA', 'us-east-1')

# Check for recent Lambda function changes
changes = get_recent_cloudtrail_events('my-function', hours_back=24)

# Find all changes around incident time
correlated = find_correlated_changes(
    incident_time="2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
    window_minutes=30,
    services="lambda,iam,apigateway"
)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

### AWS Permissions:
The new tools require additional IAM permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "health:DescribeEvents",
        "health:DescribeEventDetails",
        "health:DescribeAffectedEntities"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudtrail:LookupEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota",
        "servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### AWS Support Plan:
- **AWS Health API**: Requires Business or Enterprise support plan
- **CloudTrail**: Available on all plans (if CloudTrail is enabled)
- **Service Quotas**: Available on all plans

**Note**: If AWS Health API is not available, the tools will gracefully fail with an informative error message. The investigation will continue without AWS Health checks.

## üß™ Testing

### Test AWS Health Integration:
```bash
# Test with a known service
python -c "
from promptrca.tools import check_aws_service_health
import json
result = check_aws_service_health('LAMBDA', 'us-east-1')
print(json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=2))
"
```

### Test CloudTrail Integration:
```bash
# Test with a Lambda function
python -c "
from promptrca.tools import get_recent_cloudtrail_events
import json
result = get_recent_cloudtrail_events('my-lambda-function', 24)
print(json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=2))
"
```

### Test Full Investigation:

## üìö Best Practices

### 1. Always Check AWS Health First
```python
# In any investigation, check AWS Health before diving into code
health = check_aws_service_health(service_name, region)
if health['aws_service_issue_detected']:
    # AWS is having issues, escalate to AWS support
    return "AWS service issue detected, not an application issue"
```

### 2. Correlate Changes with Incidents
```python
# Find what changed around the incident time
changes = find_correlated_changes(
    incident_time=incident_timestamp,
    window_minutes=30  # Look 30min before incident
)

# Check if deployment happened right before incident
if changes['analysis']['deployment_detected']:
    # High probability this is a deployment issue
    # Focus investigation on recent code/config changes
```

### 3. Track IAM Changes for Permission Errors
```python
# If seeing AccessDenied errors
if 'AccessDenied' in error_message:
    # Check for recent IAM policy changes
    iam_changes = get_iam_policy_changes(role_name, hours_back=168)
    # Look for DetachRolePolicy, UpdateAssumeRolePolicy events
```
